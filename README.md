Week 3 Assignment

Problem:

      Now, having learned most of the things related to markup (HTML) and styling (CSS), we need to acquire the ability to create a responsive website using Breakpoints with media queries and Flexible Layout with flexbox, understand and apply a Mobile First design, as well as start to comprehend why the use of Javascript is so important when we are developing a website.

Solution:
      I created, from scratch, a site using elements from the first week assigment and included styling and focused on a flexible design using flexbox and media queries
      I included elments of news and also a section for ads. Please note, the ads are intentionally simple as I want the focus to be on the creative elements of the site
